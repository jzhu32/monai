# MONAI Medical Image Classifier

## Overview
This repository contains code and resources for working with [MONAI](https://monai.io/), the Medical Open Network for AI. MONAI is a PyTorch-based framework designed for deep learning in healthcare imaging applications.

## Installation
To ensure MONAI and required dependencies are installed, run the following commands:

```bash
!python -c "import monai" || pip install -q "monai-weekly[pillow, tqdm]"
!python -c "import matplotlib" || pip install -q matplotlib
%matplotlib inline
```

## Features
- Provides domain-specific tools for medical imaging AI.
- Supports data augmentation, pre-processing, and deep learning model development.
- Compatible with PyTorch and integrates with Ignite for training workflows.

## Model Deployment
The trained MONAI medical image classification model has been deployed on **Hugging Face Spaces**. You can interact with the model at the following link:
